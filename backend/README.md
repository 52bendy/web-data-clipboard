# Backend

Node.js ESM backend and management frontend host. The API routes follow a serverless-friendly layout; `src/server.js` provides the zero-dependency local development server.

Run `npm install` at the repository root, then `npm run dev`. The initial `GET /api/v1/health` route returns JSON. Collection, clipboard, devices, and webhook routes are added by their respective requirements.

## Clipboard storage service (REQ-202610-1255)

`src/services/` holds the platform-decoupled clipboard state:

- `storage/` — KV-style storage abstraction (`get` / `set` / `delete` / `update` / `purgeExpired`; contract documented in `storage/index.js`). The `memory` adapter serves local development and tests; KV/Redis adapters plug in with the runtime selection (REQ-202610-1251) without touching the business layer.
- `clipboard-store.js` — maintains the single latest clipboard record (§7.1) plus an append-only history log for the admin/statistics layer.

Semantics:

- Writes are atomic: concurrent `update` cycles serialize per key, so every accepted write takes the next server-side `seq`; the last one wins as latest and all of them are appended to history.
- Server receive time is authoritative: `updated_at` and ordering are assigned server-side, client-supplied timestamps/ids are ignored (defect 23).
- TTL: the latest record expires after `ttlMs` (default 30 minutes); expired reads return "absent" (`null`) and expired data is purged lazily on read, by the maintenance sweep, or by `purgeExpired()`.
- History retention is configurable by count and age (`0` = unlimited) and is trimmed on write and on purge.

Environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STORAGE_DRIVER` | `memory` | Storage adapter (`memory` only until REQ-202610-1251) |
| `CLIPBOARD_TTL_MS` | `1800000` | Latest-record TTL |
| `CLIPBOARD_HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES` | `500` | History retention by count (0 = unlimited) |
| `CLIPBOARD_HISTORY_TTL_MS` | `86400000` | History retention by age (0 = unlimited) |
| `CLIPBOARD_MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL_MS` | `60000` | Expiry sweep interval of the dev server |

## Verification code extraction (REQ-202610-1254)

`src/services/code-extractor.js` exposes a pure function `extractCode(text, options)` that pulls a verification code out of raw SMS text:

- Returns `{ extracted_code, type }`, where `type` is `verification_code` or `text`.
- Rules: 4–8 digit candidates (contiguous, or single-space separated groups) are scored by proximity to context keywords (验证码 / 校验码 / 动态码 / code / OTP …); order numbers, amounts, dates, alphanumeric tokens and over-long digit runs are excluded. Candidates below the score threshold are not extracted.
- Toggle: `options.autoExtract: false` makes the function return the text-only result; `AUTO_EXTRACT=false|0` flips the default in `src/config.js` until the admin settings panel (REQ-202610-1262) takes over.
- Sample set: `test/fixtures/code-samples.js` (20+ positive, 20+ negative), all covered by `npm test`.
